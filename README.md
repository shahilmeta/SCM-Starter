# Starter Next/Hardhat Project

This project serves as a starter template for a Next.js front-end integrated with a Hardhat Ethereum development environment. It includes a simple smart contract written in Solidity and a React-based front-end that interacts with the Ethereum blockchain using ethers.js.

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up and run the project on your local machine:

1. Clone the GitHub repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd your-repo
   ```

3. Install the project dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

4. Open two additional terminals in your VS Code.

5. In the second terminal, start a local Ethereum node using Hardhat:

   ```bash
   npx hardhat node
   ```

6. In the third terminal, deploy the smart contract to the local network:

   ```bash
   npx hardhat run --network localhost scripts/deploy.js
   ```

7. In the first terminal, launch the front-end:

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

8. Access the project in your web browser at [http://localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000/).

## Project Structure

- **`contracts/`**: Contains Solidity smart contract files.
- **`artifacts/`**: Stores compiled contract artifacts.
- **`scripts/`**: Includes scripts for deploying contracts.
- **`frontend/`**: Holds the Next.js React front-end code.
- **`hardhat.config.js`**: Hardhat configuration file.
- **`next.config.js`**: Next.js configuration file.
- **`package.json`**: Project configuration and dependencies.
- **`README.md`**: Project documentation.

Feel free to modify and extend this project for your Ethereum decentralized application (DApp) development.

## Notes

- Ensure you have Node.js and npm installed on your machine before proceeding.
- Make sure you have the MetaMask extension installed in your browser for Ethereum wallet interaction.
